## 👨‍🎓 About Me

Hi! I'm **Vedant**, a passionate and consistent 3rd-year Computer Science student who believes in learning by building.  
I’m currently focused on three main areas:

1. **Mastering Python** – from fundamentals to object-oriented programming  
2. **Solving DSA problems** – to crack coding interviews and build logic  
3. **Building real-world projects** – to apply what I learn and stand out to recruiters

> I believe that daily practice, discipline, and showing real work is what makes someone stand out. This repo is a reflection of my mindset: **Learn → Build → Share.**

When I'm not coding, I love exploring new tech trends, reading dev blogs, and improving myself step by step.
